# Topics in Software Engineering

This is a template repository for the topics in software engineering class I teach at CCNY.
It comes with a pre-configured devcontainer that includes most of the tools you'll need during this semester. 
If you start with this repository as a template you will have a ready to go development environment that you'll be able to 
share with your team mates. Additionally, a demo github action workflow has been setup to help you with your first assignment.

# Tools
The tools that are installed with this devcontainer are:

* act which allows you to run GitHub Actions in the local development environment.
* terraform which lets you automate infrastructure provisioning
* aws cli for interacting with AWS environment.

# For Students
CandleCraftHub

DIY enthusiasts, candle sellers, and buyers often struggle to find a centralized platform for diverse and creative candle recipes. Current sources may not cater to sellers looking to share or sell their unique recipes, and buyers might not have a dedicated space to discover a wide range of candle options. CandleCraftHub provides a user-friendly platform for DIYers, sellers, and buyers. It's a space where DIYers can explore and contribute creative candle recipes, sellers can showcase and potentially sell their unique creations, and buyers can discover a variety of candles to suit their preferences.

* DIY Enthusiasts: People passionate about creating candles, seeking inspiration and ideas.
* Candle Sellers: Individuals or businesses looking to showcase and potentially sell their unique candle recipes.
* Candle Buyers: Consumers interested in discovering and purchasing a diverse range of candles for various occasions.
